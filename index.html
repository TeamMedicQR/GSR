        GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE
       </h1>
        <p class="titlepara"> <img class="steth" src="gsr.jpg" alt="GSR">
            The galvanic skin response (GSR) is an electrical measure of the activity of sweat glands, which are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. A galvanic skin resistor (also known as a skin conductance or skin resistance sensor) is a type of sensor that measures this electrical activity by detecting changes in the electrical conductance of the skin.

The sensor works by applying a small electrical current to the skin and measuring the resulting electrical potential. As sweat is produced, the skin becomes more conductive, and the sensor detects an increase in the electrical potential. The magnitude and timing of these changes can provide information about the level of arousal or emotional response of the person being monitored.

Galvanic skin resistors have been used in a variety of applications, including lie detection, biofeedback, and research on emotion and stress.

                <h4>  It consists of four main parts: Sweat glands, Electrodes, Amplifier, Recording setup
                </h4>
                <p>Sweat glands: These are the small, coiled glands located in the skin that produce sweat in response to emotional or physical stress.
             </p>
             <p>Electrodes: These are the sensors that are attached to the skin to measure changes in the electrical conductance of the skin. There are two types of electrodes used in GSR measurements: the electrodes that measure the skin conductance level (SCL) and the electrodes that measure the skin conductance response (SCR).</p>
             <p>
                Amplifier: This is the electronic device that amplifies the electrical signal produced by the electrodes.
             </p>
             <p>
                Recording device: This is the device that records the amplified electrical signal and displays it as a waveform or a graph.

                <li>
                    A GSR sensor is a non-invasive device that requires minimum preparation/calibration. 
                <li> The operation is fairly straightforward. Two electrodes are placed where there is high density of the eccrine sweat glands, such as fingers, palms or the soles of the feet. A low voltage is applied. The skin conductance is computed by measuring the current flowing between the electrodes. </li>
                <li>
                    The fingers, palms and foot soles are the parts of the body that respond to emotional and other psychological stimuli. As shown in Exhibit 20, the middle and index finger are ideal locations to place the electrodes, typically on the non-dominant hand so that respondent is free to use the dominant hand. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If respondents need to use their fingers, such as for typing, then the palm is an option, or else the inner side of the sole of the foot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As can be seen from the exhibit, the electrodes are mounted on Velcro straps. The device is easily worn by fastening the straps.

In addition to the electrodes, the device comprises of an amplifier to boost the signal, and a digitizer to convert from the analog signal to digital.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <img class="typeimage" src="Stethoscope-types-chart.png" alt="">
            <div class="typediv">
                <h4>There are several types of stethoscopes, including:</h4> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> Cardiology stethoscope: </strong>This stethoscope is designed for use by cardiologists and other specialists who need to hear 
                        faint heart sounds. It typically has a larger chestpiece and longer tubing than a standard stethoscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pediatric stethoscope: </strong> This stethoscope is designed for use on infants and children. 
                        It typically has a smaller chestpiece and shorter tubing than a standard stethoscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Veterinary stethoscope: </strong> This stethoscope is designed for use on animals. 
                        It may have a specialized chestpiece and tubing that is more durable than a standard stethoscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope: </strong> It is five stethoscopes in one for a full range of diagnostic applications and is traditionally 
                        trusted to detect faint heart sounds and murmurs. This classic design allows healthcare professionals to assess adult, pediatric, 
                        and infant patients using just one stethoscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select lightweight stethoscope:</strong> The 3M Littmann Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope is an ideal entry-level instrument, with a tunable diaphragm, 
                        dual-sided chestpiece, and reliable acoustic performance. Its teardrop shape makes auscultation around blood pressure 
                        cuffs easier. The colors shown online are approximations.</li>
